        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <details>
            <summary>What is the purpose of this page?</summary>
            <p>The purpose is pretty simple—I wanted to prove to myself that I could create a space to build out the ideas in my head. Whether anyone else finds it interesting is secondary.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Are you trying to be and influencer?</summary>
            <p>Absolutely not. This is just a lighthearted site, not meant to be taken seriously. If you enjoyed your visit, great. If not, keep it moving—no harm, no foul.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Is the information on this website true?</summary>
            <p>While much of the information herein presented may indeed possess a certain degree of veracity, insofar as it relates to the life and experiences of the undersigned (i.e., Jermaine), it must be duly noted that said information has been subject to augmentation, embellishment, and the general polishing of facts. Such modifications have been executed with the express intent of maintaining a lighthearted atmosphere, thereby ensuring that no undue seriousness encumbers the enjoyment of this website. In other words, take everything with a grain of salt, and perhaps a dash of humor.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Why are you using an .info domain extension?</summary>
            <p>Well, I wanted to go with .io, but it turns out my budget wasn’t as futuristic as the extension. As for .com, I wasn’t interested. Plus, shout out to Dr. Janelle Caines, the proud owner of jcaines.com—I don’t know you, but keep doing your thing!</p>
        </details> 
        <details>
            <summary>Is Jermaine Caines even your real name?</summary>
            <p>Nope. And don’t bother Googling it either—you’ll just end up annoyed that you wasted time you can’t get back.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>How often do you plan on updating this site?</summary>
            <p>When I feel like it needs to be updated</p>
        </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>How many hours did it take to design this masterpiece of a website?</summary>
            <p>Too long. With kids and a wife, free time was basically non-existent. From buying the domain to finally deploying the files, it took just under a year. So yeah, a true labor of love—or something like that.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>How does one prepare to enter Jermaine's realm? Should I bring snacks, or is it more of a ‘pack your imagination’ kind of trip?</summary>
            <p>Personally, I’d start with a short prayer—just to cover all bases. As for snacks, I’m all about popcorn and Junior Mints. Because if you truly believe you’re going to dive into a realm of boundless imagination, you might as well do it with the proper sustenance. But hey, if you prefer something less cinematic, pack your imagination and maybe a sense of humor. You’ll be fine.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>Why should I join Jermaine on this journey of innovation? Will it make me more creative, or just slightly more eccentric?</summary>
            <p>Let’s be real—this is just a website, not a magic potion. It’s not going to transform you into a creative genius overnight or turn you into the next eccentric inventor. However, it might give you a spark of inspiration or a fresh perspective. And honestly, what else do you have going on that’s more intriguing than a quick stroll through someone else’s imaginative world? Whether you come out of it more creative or just entertained, that’s entirely up to you. But hey, isn’t it worth a few minutes of your time to find out?</p>
